# 🏺 Data Cards & Public Presence (Hugging Face & Kaggle)

The final stage of your data engineering work isn't just a clean file—it is a **published product**. Our cleaned datasets (or high-quality samples of them) will be hosted on **Hugging Face** and **Kaggle**.

## 📑 The "Data Card" Concept

A dataset without a Data Card is just a pile of bits. On Hugging Face, the Data Card (the `README.md` of the dataset) is the most important piece of communication. You should begin planning how to describe your work now.

**Your Data Card must eventually answer:**
* **Source:** Where did this specific subset of FineWeb come from?
* **Cleaning Logic:** What specific "noise" did your pipeline remove? (e.g., code snippets, toxic content, headers).
* **Statistics:** What is the final token count? What is the distribution of the data?
* **Intended Use:** What kind of model training is this specific slice optimized for?

## 🌎 Public vs. Private Assets

As we scale, we must be strategic about what we share with the world.

### 1. The Data (Hugging Face & Kaggle)
We will host either the full cleaned dataset or a representative "Gold Standard" sample on Hugging Face and Kaggle. This builds our team's reputation in the AI community and provides a resource for other researchers.

### 2. The Pipeline (The "Secret Sauce")
While the *data* might be public, the **pipeline code** (your scripts that actually did the cleaning) may remain **private** or restricted. 
* The ability to clean 60 TB of data efficiently is a high-value capability. 
* We may choose to keep the proprietary logic of our "cleaning recipes" internal to the JoeyLLM team while sharing the results.

## 🏗️ Planning Your Presentation

Even while you are still in the "testing" phase with 5 files, you should start a draft document (a "Pre-Data Card") that tracks:
1. **The "Why":** Why did you choose this specific subset?
2. **The "How":** What logic did you use to filter it?
3. **The "Results":** What does a "before and after" example look like?

By documenting these things as you go, you won't have to scramble to remember your logic when it comes time to publish to Kaggle and Hugging Face in Term 2.

## ✅ Action Items
- [ ] Research existing [Hugging Face Data Cards](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-cards) for inspiration.
- [ ] Keep a log of every filtering decision you make in your pipeline.
- [ ] Save "Before & After" text snippets to demonstrate your cleaning efficacy.
