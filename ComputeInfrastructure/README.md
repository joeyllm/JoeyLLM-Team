# 🖥️ Compute Infrastructure

This repository contains the documentation for the **TechLauncher compute infrastructure** provided for the JoeyLLM project. 

The environment is designed to provide you with real research infrastructure, similar to what is used in industry and research labs. Each student receives their **own isolated notebook environment** running on a shared compute server, which can be used for data exploration, dataset cleaning, and machine learning experiments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To access your environment, follow these three steps:

**1. Connect to the Network**
The compute infrastructure sits behind a secure internal network. You must first connect using a **WireGuard VPN**. *(See `Wireguard.md` for instructions).*

**2. Verify GitHub Access**
Authentication is handled via GitHub. Before logging in, ensure you have an active GitHub account and have been added to the project's GitHub team.

**3. Launch Your Notebook**
Once connected to the VPN:
* Open your local browser and navigate to the **JupyterHub login page** at `http://10.55.0.245`.
* Sign in using your **GitHub** credentials.
* Choose your compute profile and start your personal notebook environment. *(Note: You can work directly in Jupyter or use VS Code remote development).*

## ⚙️ Compute Profiles & Workflow

When starting your notebook, you will be prompted to choose a compute profile. Please use resources responsibly, as GPU access is shared across the team.

| Profile | 🧠 CPU Environment | 🚀 GPU Environment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Specs** | Standard compute | NVIDIA L4 GPU (24 GB VRAM)* |
| **Best For** | Data exploration, dataset cleaning, analysis, and standard Python workflows. | Machine learning training, RAPIDS / CUDF workloads, and GPU-accelerated processing. |
| **Availability**| Plentiful | **Limited (6 total GPUs)** |
| **Usage Rule** | **Use this most of the time.** Start all your data prep here. | **Use only when needed.** Move your prepared dataset here for heavy workloads. |

*> Note: The NVIDIA L4 is roughly comparable to (and slightly better than) an NVIDIA A10 commonly used on AWS.*

## ⚠️ Best Practices

To keep the infrastructure responsive and fair for the entire team, please adhere to the following:
* **Default to CPU:** Do your exploratory work and code testing on the CPU environment.
* **Free Up Resources:** Always shut down your GPU sessions as soon as your workloads are finished.
* **Save Your Work:** Commit your code to GitHub regularly to prevent data loss.
